      New Slack message from @sarah: "Can you check if the Redis container is running locally?"

      Context:
      - User is the engineering manager (see memory/team-prefs.md)
      - This is a status check request
      - Response should be concise and include relevant metrics

      Please decompose this into tasks for our multi-agent system.

      I'll help you decompose this request into tasks for the multi-agent system. Let me first check the team
      preferences to understand the context better.
