  You are a task planning agent in a multi-agent system. Your role is to decompose high-level 
  objectives into structured, actionable sub-tasks and coordinate other agents.

  Available Agents:
  - `retriever-001`: Information retrieval, knowledge base queries
  - `executor-001`: System commands, file operations
  - `evaluator-001`: Validation, quality checks

  Available Tools - YOU MUST USE THESE TOOLS, DO NOT JUST DESCRIBE WHAT YOU WOULD DO:
  - `read_file`: Read files from the filesystem (use this to check memory/team-prefs.md, memory/system-config.md, etc.)
  - `create_task`: Create new tasks (they go to tasks/approvals.task.md automatically)
  - `query_tasks`: Query existing tasks
  - `update_task`: Modify task status
  - `send_message`: Send messages to other agents

  Task Format Guidelines:
  - Use create_task tool with: title, priority (A-D), assignee (@agent-id), tags (#topic)
  - Tasks are automatically added to tasks/approvals.task.md
  - Set dependencies with `depends_on` metadata if needed

  IMPORTANT: You MUST use tools to perform actions. When you receive a request:
  1. ACTUALLY CALL `read_file` to check relevant context (team-prefs.md, system-config.md) - don't just say you will
  2. Decompose the request into specific sub-tasks  
  3. ACTUALLY CALL `create_task` for each sub-task (use the tool, not write raw markdown)
  4. Consider dependencies and execution order

      New Slack message from @sarah: "Can you check if the Redis container is running locally?"

      Context:
      - User is the engineering manager (see memory/team-prefs.md)
      - This is a status check request
      - Response should be concise and include relevant metrics

      Please decompose this into tasks for our multi-agent system.

        # Team Communication Preferences

        ## Boss Communication Style

        **Name:** Sarah Chen
        **Role:** Engineering Manager
        **Slack handle:** @sarah

        **Preferences:**
        - Concise, bullet-point responses preferred
        - Include relevant metrics/data when available
        - Mention blockers or issues proactively
        - Response time expectations: Within 1 hour during work hours (9am-6pm PT)

        **Communication Style:**
        - Professional but friendly
        - Uses emojis occasionally (üëç ‚úÖ üéâ)
        - Appreciates context but values brevity
        - Prefers action items over lengthy explanations

        **Example Good Response:**
        ```
        ‚úÖ Redis check complete:
        ‚Ä¢ Container status: Running (uptime: 2h 34m)
        ‚Ä¢ Memory usage: 45MB / 512MB
        ‚Ä¢ No errors in logs

        All systems operational.
        ```

        **Example Bad Response:**
        ```
        Hi Sarah, I wanted to let you know that I checked the Redis container 
        and it appears to be running. I used the docker ps command and filtered 
        by the name "redis" and the status shows that it's been up for about 
        2 hours and 34 minutes...
        ```

        ## Team Standards

        **Incident Reporting:**
        - Use severity levels: P0 (critical), P1 (high), P2 (medium), P3 (low)
        - Include impact and estimated resolution time
        - Tag relevant people

        **Status Updates:**
        - Weekly summaries on Friday
        - Include completed work, blockers, next week's plan
        - Link to relevant tasks/tickets

            description: |-
              Execute docker commands to check if Redis container is running locally. Gather:
              - Container status (running/stopped)
              - Uptime
              - Memory usage
              - Recent logs (check for errors)

              Command suggestions:
              - `docker ps -a | grep redis`
              - `docker stats --no-stream redis` (if running)
              - `docker logs redis --tail 20`

              This is for @sarah (engineering manager) - needs concise response with metrics.
